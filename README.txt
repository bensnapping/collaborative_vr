Setting up Git (and Github) on Windows:

The UnityProject folder is where the Unity files are kept for the main scene.
The AvatarAssets folder is where we can store avatar files as Travis makes changes to them.



To make changes to the repository:
If you have Git installed on your computer and connected to the repository,
open the terminal (or Git Bash on Windows)

1. Navigate to your local directory and 'git add .'

2. Then 'git commit -m "This is a description of the changes" '

3. Then 'git push'



If you're just adding a file, you can go to the Github repository at
https://github.com/bensnapping/collaborative_vr and click the "Add File"
button. Then drag the files into the repository. Don't forget to add a
commit message.
